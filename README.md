Purpose:

Using the Titanic Dataset create a new Logistic Regression model using K- Cross Validation (K from 2 to 5, multiple cases and with penalty of ridge regression) and compare the change in the the classification accuracy between the Logistic Regression model provided in the class and your new model.

Objectives:

1. Read the data.
2. Build the Logistic Regression model using the hyperparameters specified and evaluate the model's performance.
3. Compare the changes in the classification accuracy between the two Logistic Regression models.
